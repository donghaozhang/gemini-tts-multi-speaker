# Gemini TTS Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Text-to-Speech system using Google's Gemini API with multi-speaker capabilities.

## Core Architecture

The main TTS functionality is in [gemini_tts_example.py](mdc:gemini_tts_example.py), which provides:
- `text_to_speech_simple()` - Basic single-speaker TTS
- `text_to_speech_with_style()` - TTS with emotional/style control
- `text_to_speech_multi_speaker()` - Multi-speaker conversations

## Demo Applications

- [multi_speaker_demo.py](mdc:multi_speaker_demo.py) - Conversation scenarios (podcast, customer service, interviews)
- [academic_papers_demo.py](mdc:academic_papers_demo.py) - Academic paper presentations with shortened excerpts
- [full_papers_generator.py](mdc:full_papers_generator.py) - Command-line tool for full paper audio generation

## Configuration

- [.env](mdc:.env) - Contains the GEMINI_API_KEY (not tracked by git)
- [.env.example](mdc:.env.example) - Template for environment setup
- [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) - Python dependencies (google-genai>=0.8.0)

## Execution Scripts

- [run_example.bat](mdc:run_example.bat) - Run basic TTS examples
- [run_multi_speaker_demo.bat](mdc:run_multi_speaker_demo.bat) - Run conversation demos
- [run_academic_papers_demo.bat](mdc:run_academic_papers_demo.bat) - Run academic presentations

## Output Organization

All generated audio files are stored in the `result/` directory and excluded from git tracking due to file size.

## Key Features

- 30+ voice options (kore, puck, zephyr, charon, etc.)
- Style control using natural language prompts
- Multi-speaker conversations with voice assignment
- Academic content presentation capabilities
- WAV output at 24kHz, 16-bit PCM
